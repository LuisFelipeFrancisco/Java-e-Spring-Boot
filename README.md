# REST API using Java Spring Boot

This project is a Simple CRUD REST API implemented using Java, Spring Boot, Lombok, JPA, Flyway, JPA/Hibernate, and Maven.

## Introduction

This REST API serves as a backend for managing resources through CRUD operations. It's built with Java Spring Boot, which provides a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. This API follows RESTful principles, allowing for easy integration with front-end applications and other services.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources.
- **Data Persistence:** Utilizes JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate as the underlying ORM framework, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Database Migrations:** Flyway is used for database schema management and versioning, making it easy to maintain and evolve the database schema over time.
- **Simplified Development:** Lombok library reduces boilerplate code, resulting in cleaner and more concise codebase.
- **Dependency Management:** Maven is employed for managing project dependencies and building the project.
